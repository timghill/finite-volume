# Finite volume methods for conservation laws

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/finite-volume/badge/?version=latest)](https://finite-volume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This documentation describes the implementation of first-order finite volume methods on unstructured triangular methods to solve the shallow water, heat, and nonlinear heat equations.

Online documentation is hosted on [readthedocs](https://finite-volume.readthedocs.io/).

## Getting started
This project is self-contained. All the code needed to run the cases is in the repository. Some additional and useful tools include the [`cmocean`](https://matplotlib.org/cmocean/) and [`palettes`](https://github.com/timghill/palettes) packages for colourmaps.
