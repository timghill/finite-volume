# Finite volume methods for conservation laws
This documentation describes the implementation of first-order finite volume methods on unstructured triangular methods to solve the shallow water, heat, and nonlinear heat equations.

Online documentation is hosted online at [timghill.github.io/finite-volume](https://timghill.github.io/finite-volume/)

## Getting started
This project is self-contained. All the code needed to run the cases is in the repository. Some additional and useful tools include the [`cmocean`](https://matplotlib.org/cmocean/) and [`palettes`](https://github.com/timghill/palettes) packages for colourmaps.
