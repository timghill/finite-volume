# Finite volume methods for conservation laws
This documentation describes the implementation of first-order finite volume methods on unstructured triangular meshes to solve the shallow water, heat, and nonlinear heat equations.

## Shallow water equations

## Heat equation

## Nonlinear heat equation
Some inline equations, \\(\vec{F} = \nabla f)\\.

 A display equation , \\[ \iint_D fdA\\].
This equation is great.
